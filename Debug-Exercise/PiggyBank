contract PiggyBank {
    address owner;
    uint248 balance;

    function piggyBank() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        balance += uint248(msg.value);
    }

    function () {
        if (msg.sender != owner) throw;
        balance += uint248(msg.value);
    }

    function kill() {
        if (msg.sender != owner) throw;
        selfdestruct(owner);
    }
}

Bug:

1. Constructorshould be same as the contractname so in here it should be PiggyBank and not piggyBank
2. pragma solidity ^0.4.0 if this is the compiler version then it compiles well, however if we want to use a higher version,
all functions that accept a value should have payable qualifierr.
3. In more higher version of solidity throw is depricated.
